## introduction
CUDE2PNG is a tool which can batch transform .cude files to .png file.
Some image processing softwares like LightRoom or PhotoShop support .cube LUT, but some opensource softwares like digikam do not support.
So I guess somebody may need this tool for additional custom 3D LUT.

## how to 

### prerequisite

1. g++
2. put your .cube files in `datas/cubes`

### let's go
1. build:`make build` or `make run`
2. run `cude2png.exe`(I have compiled it in windows, but Linux has not been tested yet)

### result
Every .cube file will have its .png format file in `datas/pngs`
